## DBGuru's open-source codebase and curriculum
Hi, welcome to The Modern DBA Project; a project where I share my experiences, training materials, projects, etc to help you supercharge your database admin skill.

* **Who is this intended for?** This project is intended for working DBAs that are looking to modernize their skills.
* **How do it work?** This project will contain both theory and project-based learning.

### What's a 'modern DBA' ?
Just like many other IT desciplines, the database admin (DBA) is undergoing a make-over inorder to provide added value and respond to todays user demands. Traditionally DBAs have been veiwed as gatekeepers. Most traditional DBAs will tell you that it is their job to protect the company by protecting itâ€™s data. Although this is VERY true, we're at a point where we're reinvisioning the DBA as a facilitator and accelerator. This is the current state of database administration; more engineering, less administration.

The modern DBA operated more as an engineer than an administrator; meaning that he/she focused more on building database solutions than managing the database. You may think this means that the modern DBA does not care about database issue at all, however that's not what I'm saying. What I'm implying is that the modern DBA developes or integrate solutions that:
* automate routine tasks
* provide end-users self-service capabilities
* enhance observability
* cost optimization
* make database portable and agnostic of infrastructure

The modern DBA relies on a mix of tools and processes to achive these responsibilities. At this poinit we should address the elephant in the room; do modern DBAs adopt new titles? The answer is yes; modern DBAs is database ~~administrator~~ engineer. There may be slight variation from company to company, for example some places prefer to call the modern DBA a Database Reliability Engineer, or Database Engineer, or DevOps DBA.

## Roadmap
[Our roadmap](https://github.com/RKKoranteng/db-guru/wiki/Roadmap) typically looks out 12 months and we establish topics we want to work on. We'll develop our roadmaps based on the previous roadmap, the findings we made over the last year, and of course what we hear from you in issues and feature requests.

When we execute on our roadmap, we keep learning and our assessment of some of the topics listed changes. As a result, we may add or drop topics as we go.
