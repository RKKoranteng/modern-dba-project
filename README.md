Hi, welcome to **The Modern DBA Project** - a quickstart guide to help you supercharge your DBA skills to meet todays industry demands.

## What's a 'modern DBA' ?
Just like many other IT desciplines, the database admin (DBA) is undergoing a make-over inorder to provide added value and respond to todays industry demands. Traditionally DBAs have been veiwed as gatekeepers. Most DBAs will tell you that it is their job to protect the company by protecting itâ€™s data. Although this is VERY true, we're at a point where DBAs are being asked to facilitate self-services capabilitiesa, assist in accelerating product development lifecycle, make database portable and agnostic of infrastructure ... just to name a few expectations. This is the current state of DBA; more engineering, less administration.
