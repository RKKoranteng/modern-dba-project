## What is agile development?
Agile software development is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. The goal of agile development is to give teams the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. 

You may ask, 'what and why are we working in uncertain and turbulent environments'? As discussed previously, modern businesses are software driven and this demand creates a highly competitive and unpredicatble technology sector as teams work to push their feature to market quicker, address bugs, etc. An approach such as [water-fall software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) is simply outdated and can't meet the demands of modern tecnology industries.

Agile software development is broken down into two main part:
* [Scrum](#scrum): an agile (iterative and incremental) approach to managing projects
* [DevOps](#): an agile (iterative and incremental) approach to development

## Scrum
### What is scrum?
Scrum is a subset/discipline within Agile project management that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices. People often ask, "Is Scrum an acronym for something?" and the answer is no. It is actually inspired by a scrum in the sport of rugby. In rugby, the team comes together in what they call a scrum to work together to move the ball forward. In this context, Scrum is where the team comes together to move the product forward.

Scrum is not the only methodology within agile framework, but it's the most adopted within the tech sector. Here're a few of the other types of methodologies within the agile umbrella.
* Kanban
* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Lean Development
* Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

### Why scrum?
The scrum method has gained popularity within tech industry because it allows teams to self-manage, learn from experience, and adapt to change. These become competitive advantages when a team is very product/software development focused. Scrum therefore fits perfectly as a project management method for technology projects and it helps teams address the challenges mentioned earlier.

### Scrum master?
The scrum master is someone who is an expert at using the scrum method to deliver and manage projects. The scrum master role is a subset or type of project management role.

Here're some responsibilities of a scrum master:
* both a facilitator and coach who helps the team understand and apply scrum theory and practice.
* helps teams work more effectively by skillfully removing obstacles and distractions that may impede the team from meeting goals
* facilitate meetings to plan work, track progress, and discuss lessons learned.

### Sprints and sprint ceremonies
A 'sprint' is a short time period (typically two week period) when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 

Within a 'sprint' there are ceremonies. The term 'sprint ceremony' comes from the concept of celebrating key milestones within the sprint. However, they're less about celebrations and more about establishing consistent checkpoints in a projectâ€™s lifecycle. These ceremonies are essentially meetings when the scrum team meet to plan work, discuss work in progress, gather feedback, and more.

Here're the sprint ceremonies (meetings):
* **Sprint planning**: plan out what work will be completed during the upcoming sprin
* **Daily stand-up**: daily meeting for the team to update each other on their task progress
* **Sprint review**: opportunity for the development team to receive feedback from key stakeholders of a project
* **Sprint retrospective**: opportunity for team members to reflect on the past sprint
* **Backlog refinement**: identify work and estimate the level of effort (as a group)
