## What is cloud?
'Cloud' is a general term in IT field for the delivery of hosted computing services and IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. These services include servers, networks, storage, databases, development tools, and even apps ... and many more.

## Why has cloud become so popular?
Cloud computing has drastically changed the way we do IT by eliminating the need for purchasing, operating and maintaining on-premises physical data centers and servers. These responsibilities are shifted to the cloud provider. Instead of organizations having to make major investments to buy equipment, train staff, and provide ongoing maintenance, some or all of these needs are handled by a cloud service provider.
