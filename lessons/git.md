**What's Git?**

Git is an open-source command line Version Control System (VCS) originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (the guy who created Linux os/kernel). There're a few VCS's in the market, but Git has become the clear leader because it's the engine behind many popular source control tools such as Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket. Also, the Git engine works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). Git helps teams work faster and smarter; it's especially useful for DevOps teams since it helps to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

Git (also known as source control) is used to track and manage changes to code. Like other version control software, Git keeps track of every modification to code. If a mistake is made, you can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. Git does alot, but here're a few important things to know about Git:

* Git keeps track of every modification to source code
* Git support ability to rollback to previous versions of source code
* Git allows multiple developers to work collaboratively
