# Git

** What's Git?**
Git is an open-source command line version control system (VCS) originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (the guy who created Linux os/kernel). There're a few VCS's in the market, but Git has become the clear leader because it's the engine behind many popular source control tools such as Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket. Also, the Git engine works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
